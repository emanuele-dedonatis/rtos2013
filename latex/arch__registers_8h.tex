\subsection{Detailed Description}
This file should contain the list of hardware registers of the selected architecture, to allow application to directly access the hardware.

The list of these registers is usually provided by the chip vendor in the form of one or more header files.

To include these registers in a portable way, here we only include arch\-\_\-registers\-\_\-impl.\-h, which will be an header file in arch/arch name/board name/interfaces\-\_\-impl

The usual implementation of arch\-\_\-registers\-\_\-impl.\-h is simply to include the header files provided by the chip vendor.
